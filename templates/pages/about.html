<h2>Project description</h2>
This website/database will keep information about music bands and artists, what records they have done and such things.
The information about the musicians will be added and edited by anyone who wants to(kind of like wikipedia).
A user can see all information without logging in. But logging in gives benefits of saving favourites,
review/comment musicians, adding new content to the data base, upvoting reviews/comments and making top-lists. A logged in user
does also have a personal profile page, where they can find information about their previous actions.
Different search functions will exist to make it easy to find the desired musicians.
